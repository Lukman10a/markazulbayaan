The Arabic language holds immense significance for Muslims worldwide. It is the language of the Qur'ān, the Book revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).\*\* \*\*

Muslims use Arabic for worshipping Allāh, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.

In the early days of Islam, Arabic was studied as a single discipline. Over time, the study of Arabic diversified into several branches, including:

**Arabic Grammar (An-Nahw)**

**Arabic Morphology (As-Sarf)**

**Arabic Literature (Al-Adab)**

**Arabic Poetry (Al-Arood)** etc

Perfecting their understanding of Arabic is an obligation upon Muslims of all ages and genders.
