Shaikh Abdus-Salām Barjas Āl-AbdilKareem authored a very beneficial book titled:

**عوائق الطلب**

Awaaiq at-Talab (Impediments in Seeking Knowledge)

He discussed 10 major points that might hinder a student of knowledge from gaining beneficial knowledge.

Here's a summarized list of the points. I will provide details later, inshaAllah.

1. Seeking knowledge for other than the sake of Allāh.
2. Abandoning action (not acting by the knowledge).
3. Relying solely on books without consulting the people of knowledge.
4. Taking knowledge from the Asaaghir (young ignorant ones) in the presence of the scholars. [The Shakh explained here that the young ones can also teach if he is capable and there are no scholars in their land]
5. Not taking the step by step method in seeking knowledge.
6. Self conceit, Self amazement and arrogance which do affect.
7. Seeking a quick outcome.
8. Low determination.
9. Procrastination.
10. Empty wishes.

It is upon a student of knowledge to pay attention to these obstacles and impediments for him to reach his goal.
