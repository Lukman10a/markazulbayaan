# All praise is due to Allāh, Lord of all creation. 

May Allāh extol the mention of the Prophet in the highest company of Angels, and may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him, his family, his Companions, and all those who follow him exactly till the Day of Judgement.

## Introduction and Important Words of Clarification 

Islam is the Religion of all the Prophets, from Adam to Muhammad. A Muslim is anyone who embraces this Religion and acts upon it. Muslims worship none except the one true God (Arabic, Al-Ilāh), and He is Allāh. Muslims shun all forms of polytheism, and they follow the teachings of the final Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) sent to mankind. This is the basis of Salafism.

The Sunnah is the Path of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Companions. Whoever follows this path exactly is referred to as a Sunni and he is from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah. Sometimes, the term Sunni is used more generally to refer to anyone who is not from the Shi’ite sect. However, merely being a non-Shi’ite is not sufficient to save a person from falling into deviation.

**As-Salaf As-Sālih** ("The Pious Predecessors") are the Companions of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the three generations that came after them. They are also called **Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah**, **the Salaf**, **As-hābul-Hadeeth**, and **Ahlul-Hadeeth**. Whoever accepts them and follows their path precisely in belief, methodology, and religion is upon true guidance.

**Salafism (or Salafiyyah)** is the true Path in following Islam and the Sunnah. A Salafi is one who follows the path of the Salaf As-Sālih exactly without alteration.

The terms **Salafi**, **Sunni**, **Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah**, **As-hābul-Hadeeth**, and **Ahlul-Hadeeth** are interchangeable. All these titles refer to the same body of people who follow the same path. However, not everyone who uses these titles is a true adherent of what they represent. In fact, the majority of people who ascribe themselves to these labels have beliefs and methodologies in opposition to the path of the Salaf As-Sālih. To distinguish between a mere claimant and a true adherent is one of the main purposes of this article.

To be a Salafi means adhering to the **Creed, Methodology, and the way of life of the Salaf As-Sālih** (the Pious Predecessors). The earliest Salaf were the generation of our Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Companions. Then after them came the three virtuous generations of believers who held fast to the Sunnah (Path) of the Prophet and his Companions. The person who understands this path correctly, follows it exactly, without introducing anything into it or deviating from it is a Salafi. 

To be a Salafi is not merely to imagine that one is upon the true path of the Salaf, but Salafism is to study the religion of the Companions and follow it — it was they who understood best the meanings and intent of the speech and actions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). 

So, if someone asks: **“What is the Call (Da’wah) and Methodology (Manhaj) of the Salafis in learning, practising, and teaching the Religion?”** We can answer by saying: Here is our Da’wah explained in the following 89 points:

## The Salafi Call and Methodology

1. **We call, first and foremost, to the worship of Allah alone** without associating partners with Him. This was the starting point of the call of the Prophets (عليهم السلام), just as Allah has stated: 

   > "We sent a messenger to every nation proclaiming: Worship Allah alone and abandon the worship of the false deities."

   So, this call to the worship of Allah alone must be coupled with the negation of the worship of everything besides Him.

2. **We acknowledge that the Religion calls to many essentials**, therefore, we begin by inviting to the most essential affair, followed by that which is next in importance according to the Quranic and Prophetic texts. Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) commanded Mu’ādh ibn Jabal (رضي الله عنه): 

   > "Invite them firstly to the worship of Allāh alone and if they affirm that, then inform them that Allāh has obligated upon them five prayers during the night and day. If they affirm that, then inform them that Allāh has obligated upon them the Zakāt…"

3. **We hold that the Sunnah is Revelation** just as the Qur’ān is Revelation. Allāh, the Most High, said: 

   > "He (the Prophet) does not speak from his desires, rather it is not except Revelation that is sent to him."

4. **We believe that the Sunnah is whatever was conveyed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) other than the Qur’ān**. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: 

   > "Indeed I have been given the Qur’ān and that which is like it along with it."

5. **We believe that the Sunnah is whatever the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) stated or did**, and whatever was done in his presence which he did not object to. The Sunnah also includes his outward description and inward character.

6. **We hold that the best of mankind after the Prophets and Messengers** (Q) are the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) due to his saying: 

   > "The best of mankind is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them."

7. **We hold that the most excellent of these Companions is Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq**, then `Umar ibn Al-Khattāb, then `Uthmān ibn `Affān, then `Alī ibn Abī Tālib (رضي الله عنهم), then the rest of the ten Companions who were promised Paradise. Then those that fought at Badr, then those who took the oath of allegiance of Ar-Ridwān at Al-Hudaibiyah under the tree, then the rest of the Muhājiroon, then the Ansār, then those who embraced Islam before the conquest of Makkah, then those who embraced after the conquest.

8. **We dissociate ourselves from the [Rāfidah] Shī’ah and warn against them** due to their numerous heresies such as their hatred, reviling, and cursing of the wives and Companions of Allāh’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). The Messenger of Allāh (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: 

   > "Do not abuse my Companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the like of the Mount of Uhud in gold, it would not equate to even a handful of one of them, and not even half." 

   And he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: 

   > "The curse of Allāh is upon the one who curses my Companions."

9. **We believe that rectification of the Ummah lies in holding fast to the Book of Allāh and the authentic Sunnah** of Allāh’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) upon the understanding of the Companions. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: 

   > "I have left among you that which if you cling to it, you will never go astray: The Book of Allāh and my Sunnah."

   He also said: 

   > "Hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me."

10. **We believe that the attainment of unity of the Muslims and the avoidance of splitting is a fundamental command** by Allāh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Allāh, the Most High, stated: 

    > "And hold fast all of you together to the Rope of Allāh, and be not divided."

    And He said: 

    > "Do not be like those who divided and differed after there had come to them the clear proofs."

11. **We believe that the legislated unity can only be achieved when all disputation and differing between Muslims is referred back to the Book and the Sunnah** upon the understanding of the Companions. This is due to the saying of the Most High: 

    > "If you differ in any affair between yourselves, then refer it back to Allāh and His Messenger if you truly believe in Allāh and the Last Day."

    And the saying of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): 

    > "Whoever among you lives for long will see much differing and controversy, so upon you is to cling to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me. Hold on to that with your molar teeth."
