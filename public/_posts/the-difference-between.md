**اليعقوب**:
– Its plural is: اليعاقيب
– A male partridge (A bird)
– It is an Arabic word

**يعقوب (عليه السلام)**:
– A prophet of Allāh, the son of a prophet of Allāh (Is'aaq), a son of a prophet of Allāh (Ibrāhīm)
– It is a non-Arabic word

There is another word I came across (page 101 of the book) which is close to this word:

**اليَعبوب**:
Which means: A fast horse

So note the difference between these words and master the words very well.
