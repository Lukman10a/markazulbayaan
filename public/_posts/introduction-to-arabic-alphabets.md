# Introduction to Arabic Alphabet

The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters, and it is written from right to left. In this post, we'll introduce you to each letter and its sound.

## Letters of the Alphabet

- **ا (Alif)**: Pronounced like 'a' in "apple"
- **ب (Ba)**: Pronounced like 'b' in "bat"
- **ت (Ta)**: Pronounced like 't' in "tap"

Understanding these letters is the first step in learning Arabic.
